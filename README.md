# CS-5343-Graduate-Algorithm-Analysis-and-Data-Structures
This is the C++ code that I wrote in graduate Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures the Summer of 2019 at the University of Texas at Dallas.

The files are organized into 6 completed assignments as well as some extra files for test code and reviews.
Notably, the following algorithms are included in the following:

  Assignment 1:
  
    Linked List:
      Traversal
      Sorting
  Assignment 2:
  
    Binary Search Tree:
      Traversal
      Deletion
  Assignment 3:
  
    Heaps:
      Creation
      Sorting
  Assignment 4:
  
    Graphs:
      DFS Traversal
      BFS Traversal
  Assignment 5: 
  
    Dijkstra's Algorithm
  Assignment 6:
  
    Hash Tables
